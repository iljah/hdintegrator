Installation

HDIntegrator requires Python 3, and mpi4py which itself requires an implementation of the Message Passing Interface standard such OpenMPI.
HDIntegrator depends on two git submodules which you can obtain with:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/iljah/hdintegrator.git
when initially cloning the repository.
The integrands located in integrands directory each have their own requirements and prerequisites.

Integrands implemented in C++ require a C++ compiler and can be compiled automatically with GNU Make by using the Makefile located in this directory.
These integrands also require one of the following libraries: GNU GSL, cubature.

Integrands implemented in Python require the scipy package.


Testing

Integrating the x >= 0 and y >= 0 quarter of a 2d unit sphere with SciPy-based python program:

mpiexec -n 2 ./main_mpi.py --integrator integrators/N-sphere.py --dimensions 1

should give a value of 0.785, error less than 0.001 and a NaN volume of 0, for example:

0.7853981633974481 8.833911380179416e-11 0.0


The same for 3d unit sphere:

mpiexec -n 2 ./main_mpi.py --integrator integrators/N-sphere.py --dimensions 2

should give a value of 0.52, error less than 0.001 and NaN volume 0:

0.5235987763835492 1.453148457120079e-08 0.0


Integrating a 15d unit sphere with GSL-based C++ program:

mpiexec -n 2 ./main_mpi.py --integrator integrators/N-sphere --dimensions 15 --prerefine 200

should give a value of 3.6e-6, error < 1e-6 and NaN volume of 0:

3.6103624726239274e-06 2.263344140165195e-07 0.0
